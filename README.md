#ATM - Workshop
Week 3, Day 02, of Bootcamp at New York Code + Design Academy. 

###User Stories
- As a user, I want to deposit money into one of the bank accounts
- As a user, I want to withdraw money from one of the bank accounts
  - Make sure the balance in an account can't go negative. If a user tries to withdraw more money than exists in the account, ignore the transaction.
- As a user, I want overdraft protection
  - What happens when the user wants to withdraw more money from the checking account than is in the account?
  - If a withdrawal can be covered by the balances in both accounts, take the balance of the account withdrawn from down to $0 and take the rest of the withdrawal from the other account.
  - If the withdrawal amount is more than the combined account balance, ignore it.
